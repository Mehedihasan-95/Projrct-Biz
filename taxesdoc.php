              All businesses have to file an annual income tax return. C corporations pay income tax at the corporate rate, while all other businesses are considered “pass-through” entities and are taxed at the individual rate. Tax liabilty for "pass-through" entities is dependent on income according to the following table.

              <p class="pt-1">If the corporation pays dividends, shareholders pay taxes on those on their personal tax returns. So, C corporation profits are taxed twice. There are two types of dividends: qualified and unqualified. Let’s take a look at those:</p>

                <p class="pt-1"> The self-employment tax rate is 15.3% for the first $128,400 of net income</p>

                <p class="pt-1"> People who are self-employed have to pay self-employment taxes, which are Social Security and Medicare taxes.</p>
                <p class="pt-1">
                  A common misconception among foreigners is that the first roughly $100,000 of income are completely tax free in the US under the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE). This is however only partially true. The FEIE lets you exclude income from income tax. It does not get you out of paying self-employment tax on foreign income when working as freelancer, independent contractor or sole proprietor abroad.
                </p>
                <p class="pt-1">
                  Generally, self-employed individuals pay income tax and self-employment tax (SE tax). If they qualify for the FEIE, they can exclude foreign earned income up to $104,100 (2018) from income tax. (Although the FEIE will be pro-rated depending on the business expenses.) But they still have to pay self-employment tax. Being self-employed, you must pay SE tax on your entire net profit, even the amount you can exclude from income tax.

                <p class="pt-1"> However, if a US court or the IRS determines a person your company hired as an independent contractor is, in fact, an employee, you can face liabilities for not meeting the requirements of employment.</p>
                
                <p class="pt-1"> So what are the criteria for being an indepdenent contactor?</p>

                <p class="pt-1">
                  According to IRS definition, people who are in an independent trade, business or profession offering their services to the general public, are generally independent contractors. The payor for independent contractors has the right to control only the result of the work and not what will be done or how it will be done.

                  Here are three types of questions to distinguish between the two:
                </p>
                <ul class="g-list-style-disc lis-style-doc-page ml-4 pt-2">                   
                  <li> <u>Behavioral:</u> Does the company control or have the right to control what the worker does and how the worker does his or her job? If the answer is “yes,” s/he is likely a W2. If the worker is free to manage their own schedule and work process, they are more likely a 1099.</li>
                  <li>
                    <u>Financial:</u> Does the employer control the business aspects of the worker’s job? This includes for example, how the worker is paid, whether expenses are reimbursed, and who provides tools or supplies. If the company controls how the worker is paid and pays for expenses and supplies, s/he is likely a W2. If the worker has to send an invoice to get paid and/or cover their own expenses, they are more likely a 1099.
                  </li>
                  <li><u>Type of relationship:</u> Do you have a written employment contract (versus project or an independent contractor agreement) or employee-type benefits, e.g. health insurance, vacation pay? Will the working relationship continue for the foreseeable future if the work is done correctly and is the work performed a key aspect of the business? If the company provides an employee with benefits and believes the employee is there for the long-term, s/he is likely a W2. Only ONE of the questions has to be met for the employee to be considered a W2 employee.</li>
